            <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              The website of JIII ATELIER is a minimalistic portfolio website
              created by Yumi Nakaji for a production office that goes by the
              name of JIII ATELIER.<br /><br />
              This site showcases what the website is, the studio's portfolio,
              but also, it promotes the services that the studio offers to its
              clients.

            <p>
              The first thing that made me take a look at this website was its
              color palette. I am usually very much attracted to anything that
              uses pastel colors, but in this website, it mixes it with a
              gradient, which I am not always a big fan of. However, in this
              case, the overall look of the website manages to bring me a strong
              calming feeling, which accentuates the desire to interact more
              with the website.

            <h4>3. Architecture Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              The JIII ATELIER website is more formal than casual multiple
              sections and pages type of website, as the home page can be slowly
              scrolled to discover the rest of the content on the page. Which
              brings us to the menu, on the top right corner, the website
              provides the user a menu with the shape of a star inside a square,
              which opens up the different pages that are able to visit inside
              the website.<br /><br />
              Regarding its cohesiveness, the website offers on the home page
              its main services, while also showcasing some of their previous
              work, while on the menu, the order varies a little bit, and after
              the home page, the most important page (following the hierarchy
              that is on the website) is the “about” page. This can be a little
              confusing, but it doesn’t affect the easy access that the user has
              to finding the different parts of the website.<br /><br />
              Later on, we can also see some interesting things along the page,
              such as horizontal navigation where their services are provided.
              This is shown in rectangular UX cards, that are situated one
              behind the other in a horizontal carousel, which works by
              scrolling, or by clicking the pagination icons shown below those
              same UX cards. Besides this, there is also a section where instead
              of scrolling downwards, the elements come up while scrolling, but
              without the page going on on its length, much as if the screen was
              freezed, but not the elements of the page.<br /><br />
              Moreover, the textual content of the website doesn’t contain any
              mistakes. However, it is kind of brief, making it harder to
              understand some of the content, as the website itself doesn’t have
              any type of storytelling that could give the user more clues of
              the paragraphs.

            <h4>4. Visual Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              As it was mentioned before, the color palette uses different
              pastel colors, more specifically: white, pink, blue and purple,
              bringing out a softer approach of the brand.<br /><br />
              For the typography, it mainly uses three. Two sans serif ones,
              which are Satoshi, used for most of the text and Noto Sans JP,
              used only for the text that is in Japanese; and a serif one that
              is Gall, which is used as an accent, for those words that he wants
              to give more importance.<br /><br />
              Furthermore, the image style is mostly 3D illustration, which
              doesn’t really correlate with the way they are promoting the
              studio’s services. And also, there are some sections were the
              fixed elements overlap with the text, making it hard to read,
              Nevertheless, the overall experience of the website makes up for
              it, with little animations and a good layout that doesn’t look too
              overdone, but with enough space to let the user breathe through
              their scroll.

          <div class="image">
            <img
              src="images/Captura de pantalla 2025-10-15 013434.png"
              alt="UX Cards"
            />

        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="text">
            <h4>5. Interaction</h4>
            <p>
              When it comes to interaction, it is mostly easy and fun to scroll
              through the home page, as it has many 3D animations that makes the
              overall page much more immersive. For starters, the first part of
              the home page uses their logo as a 3D element that moves backwards
              the moment the scrolling starts, until one point, where it comes
              back again, until it disappears out of the viewport.<br /><br />
              Also, there is a creative touch to the menu and the rectangular UX
              cards, as the cursor changes to a large, pixelated arrow, when in
              contact with the menu icon or the UX cards part. As well, when
              there are buttons for the user to look up more information about
              that section, the buttons change from a plus icon to a little
              star, and the text buttons have a tiny animation in their letters,
              in the same way as the arcade machines, where the different
              elements turn 360º one right after the other.

            <h4>6. Usability & Accessibility</h4>
            <p>
              In general, it is easy to access the different parts of the
              website, as there isn’t much content for the user to get lost at
              some point. Nevertheless, the big UX cards in the “works” section
              do make it difficult to click on each card, as the button is very
              visible and it changes from a plus sign to a star, making it
              unclear for the user to know exactly whether they should click on
              the button or just anywhere on the UX card.<br /><br />
              Regarding the loading times, the website doesn’t take much time
              to, but it could also be hidden with the text animations that are
              happening in the meantime. Also, it is adapted to smaller devices,
              by changing the size of the bigger UX cards, and the amount of
              elements that can be added to the viewport.

              All in all, I believe that this website was aesthetically
              pleasing, and it worked well in general. It might have its little
              negative points, which may cause little mishaps on the user
              experience, but overall, it was easy and interesting.

              the website.<br /><br />

              its main services, while also showcasing some of their previous
              work, while on the menu, the order varies a little bit, and after
              the home page, the most important page (following the hierarchy
              that is on the website) is the “about” page. This can be a little
              confusing, but it doesn’t affect the easy access that the user has
              to finding the different parts of the website.<br /><br />

              behind the other in a horizontal carousel, which works by
              scrolling, or by clicking the pagination icons shown below those
              same UX cards. Besides this, there is also a section where instead
              of scrolling downwards, the elements come up while scrolling, but
              without the page going on on its length, much as if the screen was
              freezed, but not the elements of the page.<br /><br />
              Moreover, the textual content of the website doesn’t contain any
              mistakes. However, it is kind of brief, making it harder to
              understand some of the content, as the website itself doesn’t have
              any type of storytelling that could give the user more clues of
              the paragraphs.

              bringing out a softer approach of the brand.<br /><br />
              For the typography, it mainly uses three. Two sans serif ones,

              used only for the text that is in Japanese; and a serif one that
              is Gall, which is used as an accent, for those words that he wants

              Furthermore, the image style is mostly 3D illustration, which

              there are buttons for the user to look up more information about
              that section, the buttons change from a plus icon to a little
              star, and the text buttons have a tiny animation in their letters,
              in the same way as the arcade machines, where the different

              website, as there isn’t much content for the user to get lost at
              some point. Nevertheless, the big UX cards in the “works” section
              do make it difficult to click on each card, as the button is very
              visible and it changes from a plus sign to a star, making it
              unclear for the user to know exactly whether they should click on
              the button or just anywhere on the UX card.<br /><br />
              Regarding the loading times, the website doesn’t take much time
              to, but it could also be hidden with the text animations that are
              happening in the meantime. Also, it is adapted to smaller devices,
              by changing the size of the bigger UX cards, and the amount of
              elements that can be added to the viewport.

              The website of JIII ATELIER is a minimalistic portfolio website
              created by Yumi Nakaji for a production office that goes by the
              name of JIII ATELIER.<br /><br />
              This site showcases what the website is, the studio's portfolio,
              but also, it promotes the services that the studio offers to its
              clients.

              The first thing that made me take a look at this website was its
              color palette. I am usually very much attracted to anything that
              uses pastel colors, but in this website, it mixes it with a
              gradient, which I am not always a big fan of. However, in this
              case, the overall look of the website manages to bring me a strong
              calming feeling, which accentuates the desire to interact more
              with the website.

              there are buttons for the user to look up more information about
              that section, the buttons change from a plus icon to a little
              star, and the text buttons have a tiny animation in their letters,
              in the same way as the arcade machines, where the different
              elements turn 360º one right after the other.

            <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              The website of JIII ATELIER is a minimalistic portfolio website
              created by Yumi Nakaji for a production office that goes by the
              name of JIII ATELIER.<br /><br />
              This site showcases what the website is, the studio's portfolio,
              but also, it promotes the services that the studio offers to its
              clients.

            <p>
              The first thing that made me take a look at this website was its
              color palette. I am usually very much attracted to anything that
              uses pastel colors, but in this website, it mixes it with a
              gradient, which I am not always a big fan of. However, in this
              case, the overall look of the website manages to bring me a strong
              calming feeling, which accentuates the desire to interact more
              with the website.

            <h4>3. Architecture Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              The JIII ATELIER website is more formal than casual multiple
              sections and pages type of website, as the home page can be slowly
              scrolled to discover the rest of the content on the page. Which
              brings us to the menu, on the top right corner, the website
              provides the user a menu with the shape of a star inside a square,
              which opens up the different pages that are able to visit inside
              the website.<br /><br />
              Regarding its cohesiveness, the website offers on the home page
              its main services, while also showcasing some of their previous
              work, while on the menu, the order varies a little bit, and after
              the home page, the most important page (following the hierarchy
              that is on the website) is the “about” page. This can be a little
              confusing, but it doesn’t affect the easy access that the user has
              to finding the different parts of the website.<br /><br />
              Later on, we can also see some interesting things along the page,
              such as horizontal navigation where their services are provided.
              This is shown in rectangular UX cards, that are situated one
              behind the other in a horizontal carousel, which works by
              scrolling, or by clicking the pagination icons shown below those
              same UX cards. Besides this, there is also a section where instead
              of scrolling downwards, the elements come up while scrolling, but
              without the page going on on its length, much as if the screen was
              freezed, but not the elements of the page.<br /><br />
              Moreover, the textual content of the website doesn’t contain any
              mistakes. However, it is kind of brief, making it harder to
              understand some of the content, as the website itself doesn’t have
              any type of storytelling that could give the user more clues of
              the paragraphs.

            <h4>4. Visual Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              As it was mentioned before, the color palette uses different
              pastel colors, more specifically: white, pink, blue and purple,
              bringing out a softer approach of the brand.<br /><br />
              For the typography, it mainly uses three. Two sans serif ones,
              which are Satoshi, used for most of the text and Noto Sans JP,
              used only for the text that is in Japanese; and a serif one that
              is Gall, which is used as an accent, for those words that he wants
              to give more importance.<br /><br />
              Furthermore, the image style is mostly 3D illustration, which
              doesn’t really correlate with the way they are promoting the
              studio’s services. And also, there are some sections were the
              fixed elements overlap with the text, making it hard to read,
              Nevertheless, the overall experience of the website makes up for
              it, with little animations and a good layout that doesn’t look too
              overdone, but with enough space to let the user breathe through
              their scroll.

            <h4>5. Interaction</h4>
            <p>
              When it comes to interaction, it is mostly easy and fun to scroll
              through the home page, as it has many 3D animations that makes the
              overall page much more immersive. For starters, the first part of
              the home page uses their logo as a 3D element that moves backwards
              the moment the scrolling starts, until one point, where it comes
              back again, until it disappears out of the viewport.<br /><br />
              Also, there is a creative touch to the menu and the rectangular UX
              cards, as the cursor changes to a large, pixelated arrow, when in
              contact with the menu icon or the UX cards part. As well, when
              there are buttons for the user to look up more information about

                      Even though most of their animations and elements aren’t
                      very innovative, I also feel as if the way they have used
                      them brings a new perspective of how to use these types of
                      things.

                      is, but the use of only Japanese in some parts, and the
                      little pieces of information can create some doubts about
                      the information.

                      some questions to the user, making it hard to accomplish the
                      site's main goal: to get clients for the studio.
