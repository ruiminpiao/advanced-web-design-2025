            <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              The website of JIII ATELIER is a minimalistic portfolio website
              created by Yumi Nakaji for a production office that goes by the
              name of JIII ATELIER.<br /><br />
              This site showcases what the website is, the studio's portfolio,
              but also, it promotes the services that the studio offers to its
              clients.

            <p>
              The first thing that made me take a look at this website was its
              color palette. I am usually very much attracted to anything that
              uses pastel colors, but in this website, it mixes it with a
              gradient, which I am not always a big fan of. However, in this
              case, the overall look of the website manages to bring me a strong
              calming feeling, which accentuates the desire to interact more
              with the website.

            <h4>3. Architecture Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              The JIII ATELIER website is more formal than casual multiple
              sections and pages type of website, as the home page can be slowly
              scrolled to discover the rest of the content on the page. Which
              brings us to the menu, on the top right corner, the website
              provides the user a menu with the shape of a star inside a square,
              which opens up the different pages that are able to visit inside
              the website.<br /><br />
              Regarding its cohesiveness, the website offers on the home page
              its main services, while also showcasing some of their previous
              work, while on the menu, the order varies a little bit, and after
              the home page, the most important page (following the hierarchy
              that is on the website) is the “about” page. This can be a little
              confusing, but it doesn’t affect the easy access that the user has
              to finding the different parts of the website.<br /><br />
              Later on, we can also see some interesting things along the page,
              such as horizontal navigation where their services are provided.
              This is shown in rectangular UX cards, that are situated one
              behind the other in a horizontal carousel, which works by
              scrolling, or by clicking the pagination icons shown below those
              same UX cards. Besides this, there is also a section where instead
              of scrolling downwards, the elements come up while scrolling, but
              without the page going on on its length, much as if the screen was
              freezed, but not the elements of the page.<br /><br />
              Moreover, the textual content of the website doesn’t contain any
              mistakes. However, it is kind of brief, making it harder to
              understand some of the content, as the website itself doesn’t have
              any type of storytelling that could give the user more clues of
              the paragraphs.

            <h4>4. Visual Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              As it was mentioned before, the color palette uses different
              pastel colors, more specifically: white, pink, blue and purple,
              bringing out a softer approach of the brand.<br /><br />
              For the typography, it mainly uses three. Two sans serif ones,
              which are Satoshi, used for most of the text and Noto Sans JP,
              used only for the text that is in Japanese; and a serif one that
              is Gall, which is used as an accent, for those words that he wants
              to give more importance.<br /><br />
              Furthermore, the image style is mostly 3D illustration, which
              doesn’t really correlate with the way they are promoting the
              studio’s services. And also, there are some sections where the
              fixed elements overlap with the text, making it hard to read,
              Nevertheless, the overall experience of the website makes up for
              it, with little animations and a good layout that doesn’t look too
              overdone, but with enough space to let the user breathe through
              their scroll.

              alt="UX Cards"
            />
            <p>UX cards that work with horizontal scrolling</p>

          <div class="text">
            <h4>5. Interaction</h4>
            <p>
              When it comes to interaction, it is mostly easy and fun to scroll
              through the home page, as it has many 3D animations that makes the
              overall page much more immersive. For starters, the first part of
              the home page uses their logo as a 3D element that moves backwards
              the moment the scrolling starts, until one point, where it comes
              back again, until it disappears out of the viewport.<br /><br />
              Also, there is a creative touch to the menu and the rectangular UX
              cards, as the cursor changes to a large, pixelated arrow, when in
              contact with the menu icon or the UX cards part. As well, when
              there are buttons for the user to look up more information about
              that section, the buttons change from a plus icon to a little
              star, and the text buttons have a tiny animation in their letters,
              in the same way as the arcade machines, where the different
              elements turn 360º one right after the other.

            <h4>6. Usability & Accessibility</h4>
            <p>
              In general, it is easy to access the different parts of the
              website, as there isn’t much content for the user to get lost at
              some point. Nevertheless, the big UX cards in the “works” section
              do make it difficult to click on each card, as the button is very
              visible and it changes from a plus sign to a star, making it
              unclear for the user to know exactly whether they should click on
              the button or just anywhere on the UX card.<br /><br />
              Regarding the loading times, the website doesn’t take much time
              to, but it could also be hidden with the text animations that are
              happening in the meantime. Also, it is adapted to smaller devices,
              by changing the size of the bigger UX cards, and the amount of
              elements that can be added to the viewport.

            <h4>2. First Impressions</h4>
            <p>
              There’re actually two different elements that caught my eye at first: the 
              illustration style and the color palette. I believe that the little star 
              illustration feels very amicable, and mixed with the vibrant colors that they 
              have used, the site gives a really kind and soft vibe.<br><br>
              Overall, the website looks visually appealing and interesting with a first 
              quick scroll through its home page, as there are many illustrations that are able 
              to catch the user’s attention.

            <h4>3. Architecture Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              The PICTORIC website is a multiple paged website that has a casual tone to its 
              whole concept, with the use of cute illustrations that follow on their own a very 
              subtle and progressive storytelling, showing a general idea of the creative process, 
              which matches really well the concept of the website.<br><br>
              The menu on the website is already exposed on the right side of the navigation bar, 
              where it appears with a flower, which could be confused as an extension of the menu 
              too. However, the home page is organised so that it shows all the different pages 
              that the website has, and that are stated on the menu, making it easy for the user 
              to find each section, as each part has its own “more info” button.<br><br>
              Besides, without the use of any special techniques, the navigation begins by showing 
              some illustration projects, and ending with the possible subscription for their 
              illustration contest. Making it cohesive by creating a common storyline throughout 
              the whole navigation. This is achieved by showing pictures of already existing 
              artworks, and with the help of larger texts that explain what everything is in a 
              clear and uninterrupted way, and also, some key words scattered in some parts of 
              the website that help you understand their concept.

            <h4>4. Visual Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              The website, which follows a cohesive layout with many interesting animations, is 
              mainly composed by elements that use a vibrant yellow and blue, along with white 
              and grey, to create a visual balance, and not to saturate the site with too much 
              color, as the sections of the home page that showcase some illustrators’ works 
              already contain too many colors, which can look overwhelming if it is overcombined 
              with the blue and yellow used in the website’s color palette.<br><br>
              For the typography, the principal one is GT America LCGV, a sans serif typography 
              that brings out more of the casual tone of the website, and is used all along the 
              platform for big titles, subtitles, additional information and text bodies. However, 
              we can also observe that their logo uses a more geometric type of typography, which 
              kind of simulates paper cut letters, and on some animations and details they use a 
              more calligraphic typography that matches the illustration style of the site.<br><br>
              On the other hand, as it was mentioned previously, the image (illustration) style that 
              this site possesses is friendly and organic, with a cute vibe to it. And it is this 
              image style that brings the visual side of the website to match with its main message, 
              to bring illustrators around the world together.

            <h4>5. Interaction</h4>
            <p>
              The interactivity of this website is truly entertaining since the start of the home 
              page. At the very top, on the navigation bar we can find an animated logo, where its 
              letters rotate 360º one after the other, and a menu that has hovering effects, along 
              with a little flower illustration that not only rotates on its axis while the user 
              scrolls through the length of the home page, but it shows an animated quote when it’s 
              clicked on too.<br><br>
              Then, on the home page there are some other interesting interactions, as the page 
              itself starts with a hero interaction. Starting with the hovering elements, there 
              are two sections in which we can find some circles of different sizes, where the 
              small ones may contain words or illustrations. Those circles move when hovered, and 
              the ones at the top of the home page are even accessible, taking the user to a new 
              page of the website. Additionally, in some sections, the cursor changes to a 
              circumference that lets you drag the different elements in that part. Following 
              that, there is a very compelling section, which is the one for their contest. On 
              this part, the cursor will draw a thick line, which will slowly disappear, wherever 
              it hovers, and this interaction is also applied to their boutique page, which is now 
              empty.<br><br>
              The site may not use any sounds or 3D elements, but the combination of the existing 
              interactions makes it creative and fun to see, as the user can play with many different 
              parts of the website, instead of just scrolling through it.

              The loading time is friendly, as the only moment that it takes “longer” to load 
              is when the user first opens the website. Nevertheless, the loading time is clearly 
              shown on the screen, making the wait more accessible and easy.<br><br>
              Regarding the user experience, the navigation follows a clear order that is easy 
              to comprehend, without many things that can be truly confusing for the user. Except 
              for the little flower icon on the navigation bar, which disappears on smaller devices 
              where the responsiveness of the website changes the whole navigation bar and substitutes 
              it for their logo and a hamburger menu icon.

              This is a website dedicated to a fake Swedish candy brand called BOMBON, 
              which was built as inspiration for other product brands. Because of its 
              long name “Bombon Royal Swedish Candy”, the whole branding, and therefore 
              website, is inspired in a candy kingdom, where the main characters are the 
              different types of candy that this brand sells.

              a soft feeling on the viewer. The castle and the different candies

            <h4>3. Architecture Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              The website of BOMBON is a multiple section website that, with a 
              casual and close tone, chooses to immerse their clients into a 
              magical storyline to sell their products.<br /><br />
              The home page starts with a navigation bar that displays the brand’s 
              logo and the two most important pages for a website that is dedicated 
              to a product, their shop and the customer’s cart, along with an integrated 
              menu that opens up the different pages that the website has, excluding 
              the shopping cart.<br /><br />
              From the navigation bar, the website already states the organisation of 
              the website, showing that the shop is the main page, apart from the home 
              page, where the user gets a summary of what this brand sells, and right 
              after that, little UX cards of their products. This cohesive navigation 
              is maintained throughout all the website, as the main purpose of the site 
              is to sell their product.<br /><br />
              Furthermore, along the navigation we can find the use of some special 
              techniques such as horizontal navigation used for the section with the 
              UX cards that depict their mixed products, or the element stacking that 
              is used by the end of the home page, to show their previous customer’s 
              opinions on their products. All of these, together with their descriptive 
              texts really make a difference on the easy access to the different pages 
              of this site. Nevertheless, these two interactions are included in the 
              navigation flow of the home page, which can cause a little bit of confusion, 
              as they are not scrollings that can be done separately.

            <h4>4. Visual Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              For their color palette, their main colors are purple, white, 
              black and a greenish yellow, which works well because of the 
              complementary state of the purple and yellow colors. Besides, 
              this combination really brings out a more fluffy and magical, 
              but mysterious vibe to the website, making it consistent with 
              their branding.<br /><br />
              Additionally, they use two sans serif typographies for their site. 
              Akina is the one used for the titles, which are big and bold, 
              bringing a lot of visual weight to the titles on this site. 
              And Roundo is the typography used for the rest of the texts, 
              because of its lighter weight and simpler shapes, it balances out 
              the difference between these two typographies and how they work 
              on the website.<br /><br />
              On the other side, the imagery is mostly static 3D objects, more 
              specifically their candy, which is used for the main part of the 
              home page, and also for interactive UX cards. The use of these 
              images matches the message of the website, as by showing the way 
              that their product looks will lead customers to grow their faith 
              for this brand and what it sells.<br><br>
              And lastly, the layout is structured in an organised way, but the 
              great amount of elements, together with the large size that they 
              have might make the website look kind of overdone in the long run.

            <h4>5. Interaction</h4>
            <p>
              The first interactions that the user will find are a little game 
              that can be opened by clicking on the yellow CTA button that 
              appears at the top of the home page, and a music note icon on the 
              bottom left corner of the viewport, where the user can decide whether 
              they want to navigate the website with or without music.<br /><br />
              These types of fun interactions continue the more we scroll, because 
              the further we go, we don’t only just see some animations on the texts 
              that appear on the website, but also, there are many buttons that can 
              be clicked for animations to appear or carousels to move, and many 
              other elements that change with a quick hover.<br><br>
              From that last part, there's an especially creative section that 
              depicts a candy kingdom, where the user will be able to click on 
              some buttons to see how this brand has used famous paintings to 
              make their brand more fun. Even if it doesn’t really correlate 
              with the brand’s image, it does give the website a more artistic point.

            <h4>6. Usability & Accessibility</h4>
            <p>
              This Swedish candy website encompasses a series of elements that when 
              combined make the user experience quite exciting, because the user 
              cannot really know how the next section is going to work out. In 
              addition, something that makes the user experience even more enjoyable 
              is its short loading times, which quickly shows the user the pages 
              that they want to navigate through. Still, there is also a negative 
              side to the navigation through this website, as it was said before, 
              their elements are abundant and large in size, not letting much space 
              for the website to breath, which can make the navigation experience 
              slightly heavy in some parts.<br /><br />
              Nevertheless, it was mentioned before the amusing effect that their 
              interactive imaginary causes to the user, and even though the website 
              is adapted for smaller devices, the interactive imagery is forgotten 
              on the mobile version, as it isn’t really possible to hover on a phone, 
              but those that are just animations are still available even when the 
              website is adapted so that it’s responsive for different-sized devices.

              ORAGE is a portfolio website for the creative post production 
              studio of Orage studio. In this website, they showcase the 
              different works that they have done since 2021, and on top of 
              that, they display the different services that the studio applies.<br /><br />
              Furthermore, there are other things that can be done through this website, 
              such as applying for a job in this studio, or finding all their different 
              socials and contact forms.

              When I first saw the thumbnail of this website, I thought it was a 
              F1 dedicated website, which made me curious enough to look it up. 
              Little did I know that what I would find would be much more impressive 
              than that.<br><br>
              The website has a very unique and digital style that is able to catch 
              people’s attention through the layout, as the composition has a messy 
              but well done and organised touch, which can cause some curiosity.

            <h4>3. Architecture Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              ORAGE is a website with more of a casual and informal tone of 
              voice and some of the things that are worth highlighting from 
              this website is definitely its composition, as none of its 
              elements follow the convenient way of arrangement.<br /><br />
              For starters, their navigation bar is right in the middle of 
              the page, with the menu at the very front of it. Furthermore, 
              the content of this navigation bar changes depending on the 
              page that the user is navigating through. In some cases, this 
              type of organisation would lead to a confusing navigation, but 
              in this case, it doesn’t affect its natural navigation flow.<br /><br />
              The reason for that is because of the organisation of the website, 
              as each page only contains its designated parts. That is to say, 
              on the home page the user will only find introductory short clips 
              of their works, without giving any type of clue about the 
              information that may go in the “about us” page or in “contact” 
              one. Also, having the type of navigation bar that this website 
              provides, really makes it easier for the user to go from one 
              page to the other, and in an ordered way because of its 
              dedicated-page theme.<br /><br />
              Besides, each of these pages follows a different technique too. 
              While the home and the about page use the one-page technique, 
              the contact page is simply a smaller window that will appear 
              on the users screen, and the pages that showcase their projects 
              and the studio have an infinite layout that lets the user to 
              scroll continually and have a quick view of everything that 
              this studio is able to provide as a post production team.

            <h4>4. Visual Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              This page uses a much more minimalistic theme, by using only 
              black and white for their brand’s colors. Nevertheless, because 
              of their colorful works, the use of black and white creates the 
              perfect balance between the brand and its works.<br /><br />
              The main typography that they use is PP Supply Mono. This is a 
              sans serif typography that simulates the typography that is 
              normally used on futuristic films for computer programs, which 
              creates a great cohesiveness with the technology-inspired 
              elements that this website has. And apart from that, they use, 
              for the page title, a bold sans serif typography on their 
              backgrounds too, which also contributes to creating depth on the 
              visual aspect of the website.<br /><br />
              For their imagery, there aren’t many images outside of the videos 
              that show their works. However, the simple background elements and 
              texts do help to make the background look less empty, while also 
              contributing to the construction of the aesthetic of the site, which 
              matches the aesthetic of their works.

            <p>
              When it comes to interaction, most of the elements on their website 
              are interactive in a very creative way.  Starting from the very 
              bottom, there’s the contact page, which is a small popup element 
              that appears in the middle of the website as an animated piece, 
              as if someone was writing code.<br /><br />
              Moreover, it’s the draggable elements. Firstly, that previously 
              mentioned navigation bar, which is initially situated in the middle 
              of the screen, has a little icon at the very front, which marks that 
              the element is draggable, making it easier for the user to look at 
              the content on each page without any type of interruption. What’s 
              more, when the user drags it somewhere, the navigation bar will stay 
              in that position through all the pages until it’s moved again.<br><br>
              Secondly, the user will find on the screen of the home page many small 
              windows that will show the same video in a deconstructed way. Not only 
              can the user click on this videos, which will make a popup video, with 
              audio, to appear, but also, all these windows can be dragged to any part 
              of the screen, while continuing to play the video, however, depending on 
              where that window is located, it will show a section or another from that 
              video that it keeps replaying.<br><br>
              Something similar happens on the project and studio pages, where the user 
              will also find a lot of windows, but in this case, these will show a 
              thumbnail that starts playing a video when it is hovered on. Again, all 
              these videos can be played by clicking on them, and will appear as a popup.

            <h4>6. Usability & Accessibility</h4>
            <p>
              At first sight, the overall composition of the website might make 
              it seem as if the navigation would be kind of messy. Nonetheless, 
              the user experience is rather logical and smooth. This is all 
              achieved through its easy access to the menu, and the minimalistic 
              type of website that it is, as it only showcases the most important 
              things of each page in a direct way.<br /><br />
              In addition, the loading time doesn’t seem long, as it uses a loader 
              animation which entertains the user, making it seem as if the loading 
              time isn’t long. This loader is adapted into a simpler animation for 
              the mobile version, where the layout seems more structured because of 
              its reduced space.
