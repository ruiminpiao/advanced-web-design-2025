            <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              The website of JIII ATELIER is a minimalistic portfolio website
              created by Yumi Nakaji for a production office that goes by the
              name of JIII ATELIER.<br /><br />
              This site showcases what the website is, the studio's portfolio,
              but also, it promotes the services that the studio offers to its
              clients.

            <p>
              The first thing that made me take a look at this website was its
              color palette. I am usually very much attracted to anything that
              uses pastel colors, but in this website, it mixes it with a
              gradient, which I am not always a big fan of. However, in this
              case, the overall look of the website manages to bring me a strong
              calming feeling, which accentuates the desire to interact more
              with the website.

            <h4>3. Architecture Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              The JIII ATELIER website is more formal than casual multiple
              sections and pages type of website, as the home page can be slowly
              scrolled to discover the rest of the content on the page. Which
              brings us to the menu, on the top right corner, the website
              provides the user a menu with the shape of a star inside a square,
              which opens up the different pages that are able to visit inside
              the website.<br /><br />
              Regarding its cohesiveness, the website offers on the home page
              its main services, while also showcasing some of their previous
              work, while on the menu, the order varies a little bit, and after
              the home page, the most important page (following the hierarchy
              that is on the website) is the “about” page. This can be a little
              confusing, but it doesn’t affect the easy access that the user has
              to finding the different parts of the website.<br /><br />
              Later on, we can also see some interesting things along the page,
              such as horizontal navigation where their services are provided.
              This is shown in rectangular UX cards, that are situated one
              behind the other in a horizontal carousel, which works by
              scrolling, or by clicking the pagination icons shown below those
              same UX cards. Besides this, there is also a section where instead
              of scrolling downwards, the elements come up while scrolling, but
              without the page going on on its length, much as if the screen was
              freezed, but not the elements of the page.<br /><br />
              Moreover, the textual content of the website doesn’t contain any
              mistakes. However, it is kind of brief, making it harder to
              understand some of the content, as the website itself doesn’t have
              any type of storytelling that could give the user more clues of
              the paragraphs.

            <h4>4. Visual Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              As it was mentioned before, the color palette uses different
              pastel colors, more specifically: white, pink, blue and purple,
              bringing out a softer approach of the brand.<br /><br />
              For the typography, it mainly uses three. Two sans serif ones,
              which are Satoshi, used for most of the text and Noto Sans JP,
              used only for the text that is in Japanese; and a serif one that
              is Gall, which is used as an accent, for those words that he wants
              to give more importance.<br /><br />
              Furthermore, the image style is mostly 3D illustration, which
              doesn’t really correlate with the way they are promoting the
              studio’s services. And also, there are some sections where the
              fixed elements overlap with the text, making it hard to read,
              Nevertheless, the overall experience of the website makes up for
              it, with little animations and a good layout that doesn’t look too
              overdone, but with enough space to let the user breathe through
              their scroll.

              alt="UX Cards"
            />

        </div>

          <div class="text">
            <h4>5. Interaction</h4>
            <p>
              When it comes to interaction, it is mostly easy and fun to scroll
              through the home page, as it has many 3D animations that makes the
              overall page much more immersive. For starters, the first part of
              the home page uses their logo as a 3D element that moves backwards
              the moment the scrolling starts, until one point, where it comes
              back again, until it disappears out of the viewport.<br /><br />
              Also, there is a creative touch to the menu and the rectangular UX
              cards, as the cursor changes to a large, pixelated arrow, when in
              contact with the menu icon or the UX cards part. As well, when
              there are buttons for the user to look up more information about
              that section, the buttons change from a plus icon to a little
              star, and the text buttons have a tiny animation in their letters,
              in the same way as the arcade machines, where the different
              elements turn 360º one right after the other.

            <h4>6. Usability & Accessibility</h4>
            <p>
              In general, it is easy to access the different parts of the
              website, as there isn’t much content for the user to get lost at
              some point. Nevertheless, the big UX cards in the “works” section
              do make it difficult to click on each card, as the button is very
              visible and it changes from a plus sign to a star, making it
              unclear for the user to know exactly whether they should click on
              the button or just anywhere on the UX card.<br /><br />
              Regarding the loading times, the website doesn’t take much time
              to, but it could also be hidden with the text animations that are
              happening in the meantime. Also, it is adapted to smaller devices,
              by changing the size of the bigger UX cards, and the amount of
              elements that can be added to the viewport.

              All in all, I believe that this website was aesthetically
              pleasing, and it worked well in general. It might have its little
              negative points, which may cause little mishaps on the user
              experience, but overall, it was easy and interesting.

              Founded in 2014, PICTORIC is a website made by a group of independent Ukrainian curators to build a creative circle for different illustrators and designers, make new projects come alive, and also, to organize exhibitions and workshops.<br><br> The main purpose of this website is not only to support illustrators and other creative people around the world, but to spread knowledge about Ukrainian culture and, to advertise the need of a higher importance of the visual language in the academic and social sector.

            <p>
              There’re actually two different elements that caught my eye at first: the illustration style and the color palette. I believe that the little star illustrations feels very amicable, and mixed with the vibrant colors that they have used, the site gives a really kind and soft vibe.<br><br> Overall, the website looks visually appealing and interesting with a first quick scroll through its home page, as there are many illustrations that are able to catch the user’s attention.

            <h4>3. Architecture Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              The PICTORIC website is a multiple paged website that has a casual tone to its whole concept, with the use of cute illustrations that follow on their own a very subtle and progressive storytelling, showing a general idea of the creative process, which matches really well the concept of the website.<br /><br />
              The menu on the website is already exposed on the right side of the navigation bar, where it appears with a flower, which could also be confused as an extension of the menu. However, the home page is organised so that it shows all the different pages that the website has, and that are stated on the menu, making it easy for the user to find each section, as each part has its own “more info” button.<br /><br />
              Besides, without the use of any special techniques, the navigation begins by showing some illustration projects, and ending with the possible subscription for their illustration contest. Making it cohesive by creating a common storyline throughout the whole navigation. This is achieved by showing pictures of already existing artworks, and with the help of larger texts that explain what everything is in a clear and uninterrupted way, and also, some key words scattered in some parts of the website that help you understand their concept.

            <h4>4. Visual Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              The website, which follows a cohesive layout with many interesting animations, is mainly composed by elements that use a vibrant yellow and blue, along with white and grey, to create a visual balance, and not to saturate the site with too much color, as the sections of the home page that showcase some illustrators’ works already contain too many colors, which can look overwhelming if it is overcombined with the blue and yellow used in the website’s color palette.<br /><br />
              For the typography, the principal one is GTAmericaLCGV, a sans serif typography that brings out more of the casual tone of the website, and is used all along the platform for big titles, subtitles, additional information and text bodies. However, we can also observe that their logo uses a more geometric type of typography, which kind of simulates paper cut letters, and on some animations and details they use a more calligraphic typography that matches the illustration style of the site.<br /><br />
              On the other hand, as it was mentioned previously, the image (illustration) style that this site possesses is friendly and organic, with a cute vibe to it. And it is this image style that brings the visual side of the website to match with its main message, to bring illustrators around the world together.

            <h4>5. Interaction</h4>
            <p>
              The interactivity of this website is truly entertaining since the start of the home page. At the very top, on the navigation bar we can find an animated logo, where its letters rotate 360º one after the other, and a menu that has hovering effects, along with a little flower illustration that not only rotates on its axis while the user scrolls through the length of the home page, but it also shows an animated quote when it’s clicked on.<br /><br />
              Then, on the home page there are some other interesting interactions. Starting from the hovering elements, there are two sections in which we can find some circles of different sizes, where the small ones may contain words or illustrations. Those circles move when hovered, and the ones at the top of the home page are even accessible, taking the user to a new page of the website. Also, in some sections, the cursor changes to a circumference that lets you drag the different elements in that part. Following that, there is a very compelling section, which is the one for their contest. On this part, the cursor will draw a thick line, which will slowly disappear, wherever it hovers, and this interaction is also applied to their boutique page, which is now empty.<br><br> The site may not use any sounds or 3D elements, but the combination of the existing interactions makes it creative and fun to see, as the user can play with many different parts of the website, instead of just scrolling through it.

              Regarding the user experience, the navigation follows a clear order that is easy to comprehend, without many things that can be truly confusing for the user. Except for the little flower icon on the navigation bar, which disappears on smaller devices where the responsiveness of the website changes the whole navigation bar and substitutes it for their logo and a hamburger menu icon.

            <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              The website of JIII ATELIER is a minimalistic portfolio website
              created by Yumi Nakaji for a production office that goes by the
              name of JIII ATELIER.<br /><br />
              This site showcases what the website is, the studio's portfolio,
              but also, it promotes the services that the studio offers to its
              clients.

            <p>
              The first thing that made me take a look at this website was its
              color palette. I am usually very much attracted to anything that
              uses pastel colors, but in this website, it mixes it with a
              gradient, which I am not always a big fan of. However, in this
              case, the overall look of the website manages to bring me a strong
              calming feeling, which accentuates the desire to interact more
              with the website.

            <h4>3. Architecture Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              The JIII ATELIER website is more formal than casual multiple
              sections and pages type of website, as the home page can be slowly
              scrolled to discover the rest of the content on the page. Which
              brings us to the menu, on the top right corner, the website
              provides the user a menu with the shape of a star inside a square,
              which opens up the different pages that are able to visit inside
              the website.<br /><br />
              Regarding its cohesiveness, the website offers on the home page
              its main services, while also showcasing some of their previous
              work, while on the menu, the order varies a little bit, and after
              the home page, the most important page (following the hierarchy
              that is on the website) is the “about” page. This can be a little
              confusing, but it doesn’t affect the easy access that the user has
              to finding the different parts of the website.<br /><br />
              Later on, we can also see some interesting things along the page,
              such as horizontal navigation where their services are provided.
              This is shown in rectangular UX cards, that are situated one
              behind the other in a horizontal carousel, which works by
              scrolling, or by clicking the pagination icons shown below those
              same UX cards. Besides this, there is also a section where instead
              of scrolling downwards, the elements come up while scrolling, but
              without the page going on on its length, much as if the screen was
              freezed, but not the elements of the page.<br /><br />
              Moreover, the textual content of the website doesn’t contain any
              mistakes. However, it is kind of brief, making it harder to
              understand some of the content, as the website itself doesn’t have
              any type of storytelling that could give the user more clues of
              the paragraphs.

            <h4>4. Visual Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              As it was mentioned before, the color palette uses different
              pastel colors, more specifically: white, pink, blue and purple,
              bringing out a softer approach of the brand.<br /><br />
              For the typography, it mainly uses three. Two sans serif ones,
              which are Satoshi, used for most of the text and Noto Sans JP,
              used only for the text that is in Japanese; and a serif one that
              is Gall, which is used as an accent, for those words that he wants
              to give more importance.<br /><br />
              Furthermore, the image style is mostly 3D illustration, which
              doesn’t really correlate with the way they are promoting the
              studio’s services. And also, there are some sections were the
              fixed elements overlap with the text, making it hard to read,
              Nevertheless, the overall experience of the website makes up for
              it, with little animations and a good layout that doesn’t look too
              overdone, but with enough space to let the user breathe through
              their scroll.

            <h4>5. Interaction</h4>
            <p>
              When it comes to interaction, it is mostly easy and fun to scroll
              through the home page, as it has many 3D animations that makes the
              overall page much more immersive. For starters, the first part of
              the home page uses their logo as a 3D element that moves backwards
              the moment the scrolling starts, until one point, where it comes
              back again, until it disappears out of the viewport.<br /><br />
              Also, there is a creative touch to the menu and the rectangular UX
              cards, as the cursor changes to a large, pixelated arrow, when in
              contact with the menu icon or the UX cards part. As well, when
              there are buttons for the user to look up more information about
              that section, the buttons change from a plus icon to a little
              star, and the text buttons have a tiny animation in their letters,
              in the same way as the arcade machines, where the different
              elements turn 360º one right after the other.

            <p>
              In general, it is easy to access the different parts of the
              website, as there isn’t much content for the user to get lost at
              some point. Nevertheless, the big UX cards in the “works” section
              do make it difficult to click on each card, as the button is very
              visible and it changes from a plus sign to a star, making it
              unclear for the user to know exactly whether they should click on
              the button or just anywhere on the UX card.<br /><br />
              Regarding the loading times, the website doesn’t take much time
              to, but it could also be hidden with the text animations that are
              happening in the meantime. Also, it is adapted to smaller devices,
              by changing the size of the bigger UX cards, and the amount of
              elements that can be added to the viewport.

            <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              The website of JIII ATELIER is a minimalistic portfolio website
              created by Yumi Nakaji for a production office that goes by the
              name of JIII ATELIER.<br /><br />
              This site showcases what the website is, the studio's portfolio,
              but also, it promotes the services that the studio offers to its
              clients.

            <p>
              The first thing that made me take a look at this website was its
              color palette. I am usually very much attracted to anything that
              uses pastel colors, but in this website, it mixes it with a
              gradient, which I am not always a big fan of. However, in this
              case, the overall look of the website manages to bring me a strong
              calming feeling, which accentuates the desire to interact more
              with the website.

            <h4>3. Architecture Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              The JIII ATELIER website is more formal than casual multiple
              sections and pages type of website, as the home page can be slowly
              scrolled to discover the rest of the content on the page. Which
              brings us to the menu, on the top right corner, the website
              provides the user a menu with the shape of a star inside a square,
              which opens up the different pages that are able to visit inside
              the website.<br /><br />
              Regarding its cohesiveness, the website offers on the home page
              its main services, while also showcasing some of their previous
              work, while on the menu, the order varies a little bit, and after
              the home page, the most important page (following the hierarchy
              that is on the website) is the “about” page. This can be a little
              confusing, but it doesn’t affect the easy access that the user has
              to finding the different parts of the website.<br /><br />
              Later on, we can also see some interesting things along the page,
              such as horizontal navigation where their services are provided.
              This is shown in rectangular UX cards, that are situated one
              behind the other in a horizontal carousel, which works by
              scrolling, or by clicking the pagination icons shown below those
              same UX cards. Besides this, there is also a section where instead
              of scrolling downwards, the elements come up while scrolling, but
              without the page going on on its length, much as if the screen was
              freezed, but not the elements of the page.<br /><br />
              Moreover, the textual content of the website doesn’t contain any
              mistakes. However, it is kind of brief, making it harder to
              understand some of the content, as the website itself doesn’t have
              any type of storytelling that could give the user more clues of
              the paragraphs.

            <h4>4. Visual Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              As it was mentioned before, the color palette uses different
              pastel colors, more specifically: white, pink, blue and purple,
              bringing out a softer approach of the brand.<br /><br />
              For the typography, it mainly uses three. Two sans serif ones,
              which are Satoshi, used for most of the text and Noto Sans JP,
              used only for the text that is in Japanese; and a serif one that
              is Gall, which is used as an accent, for those words that he wants
              to give more importance.<br /><br />
              Furthermore, the image style is mostly 3D illustration, which
              doesn’t really correlate with the way they are promoting the
              studio’s services. And also, there are some sections were the
              fixed elements overlap with the text, making it hard to read,
              Nevertheless, the overall experience of the website makes up for
              it, with little animations and a good layout that doesn’t look too
              overdone, but with enough space to let the user breathe through
              their scroll.

              alt="UX Cards"
            />

        </div>

          <div class="text">
            <h4>5. Interaction</h4>
            <p>
              When it comes to interaction, it is mostly easy and fun to scroll
              through the home page, as it has many 3D animations that makes the
              overall page much more immersive. For starters, the first part of
              the home page uses their logo as a 3D element that moves backwards
              the moment the scrolling starts, until one point, where it comes
              back again, until it disappears out of the viewport.<br /><br />
              Also, there is a creative touch to the menu and the rectangular UX
              cards, as the cursor changes to a large, pixelated arrow, when in
              contact with the menu icon or the UX cards part. As well, when
              there are buttons for the user to look up more information about
              that section, the buttons change from a plus icon to a little
              star, and the text buttons have a tiny animation in their letters,
              in the same way as the arcade machines, where the different
              elements turn 360º one right after the other.

            <h4>6. Usability & Accessibility</h4>
            <p>
              In general, it is easy to access the different parts of the
              website, as there isn’t much content for the user to get lost at
              some point. Nevertheless, the big UX cards in the “works” section
              do make it difficult to click on each card, as the button is very
              visible and it changes from a plus sign to a star, making it
              unclear for the user to know exactly whether they should click on
              the button or just anywhere on the UX card.<br /><br />
              Regarding the loading times, the website doesn’t take much time
              to, but it could also be hidden with the text animations that are
              happening in the meantime. Also, it is adapted to smaller devices,
              by changing the size of the bigger UX cards, and the amount of
              elements that can be added to the viewport.

              All in all, I believe that this website was aesthetically
              pleasing, and it worked well in general. It might have its little
              negative points, which may cause little mishaps on the user
              experience, but overall, it was easy and interesting.
